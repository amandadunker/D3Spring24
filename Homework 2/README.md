This bar chart shows when the songs I am practicing were released. Most are from the 1980s. 

Questions: 
* My original dataset (songs.csv) has a row for each song, but I couldn't use it because I couldn't figure out how to make "count" work.
* I have to learn how to change the color of the axes to white to make this palette work but it doesn't seem like an attribute? When I figure that out it's going to look like the cover of "Rio." 
* I also made a scatterplot of year of release versus BPM but it didn't work without a label, which would have to come from different columns than my x and y (title and artist). I couldn't make the labels work.
