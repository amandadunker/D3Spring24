Coursework for Computational Fundamentals: D3.

I am currently earning my M.S. in Data Analysis and Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center. Before that I was Director of Health Policy at an advocacy organization in New York City focusing on medical debt, coverage for undocumented people, and hospital financial assistance policies. I have an MPP from the University of Chicago and a BA in Media Studies from the University of Buffalo.
