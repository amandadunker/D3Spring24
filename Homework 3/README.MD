This shows the number of press statements released per week by members of Congress that contain the words "God", "prayer", "Jesus", or "Lord". I searched for the statements using ProPublica's Congress API (https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/statements/). I have removed duplicates but have not yet verfied all the statements - for example, one of these spikes is occuring because a member of Congress with the name Jesus was on a bill with several other Representatives and all of thier statements mentioned him. I am working on a timeline of events for the other spikes.
